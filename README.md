Projects associated with CS320: Advanced Computer Architecture

Project 1: Branch Predictor Simulator
- Simulates predictions of always taken, never taken, bimodal single bit, bimodal double bit, gshare, and tournament predictors, along with a
branch target buffer simulator.

Projec 2: Cache Simulator
- Simulates predictions of direct-mapped, set-associative, fully-associative, LRU fully-associative, hot-cold fully-associative, no
allocation on write-miss set-associative, next-line prefetch set-associative, and prefetch on a miss set-associative caches.
